You need java and sqlite3 installed

Go to the folder brilliantly located at ../run/run .

First set up the sqlite database using the initiate_sqlitedb.sql file.

Then run this from the terminal " java -jar PrototypeY2.jar Rosetta-SIP"

This will do the SIP generation of the content placed in the "content" folder.

Currently you need java version "51" (internal name) for it to work. #willfix.
